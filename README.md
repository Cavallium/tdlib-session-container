TDLib session container
=======================

This software is a wrapper for [TDLight Java](https://github.com/tdlight-team/tdlight-java)

Unlike TDLight java, this wrapper abstracts TDLib to make it possible to run remotely,
decoupling it into a client and a server.

TDLib session container can be used in various ways:
 - Clustered
 - Remote
 - Local
 - Direct (The client process, as TDLight java)
